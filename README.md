| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `chat`      | The `chat` plugin enables real-time interaction with the ChatGPT model directly in the terminal, allowing users to chat and get answers quickly and efficiently.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `command`   | The `command` plugin allows users to describe their desired command in natural language, and then outputs the corresponding plugin to fulfill the user's request. For example, if the user inputs "show all js files in the current folder", the plugin will output the corresponding plugin to display all the .js files in the current folder. This plugin makes it easier for users to find and utilize the appropriate plugins for their needs.                                          |
| `translate` | The translate plugin allows users to easily translate text within the terminal. By using this plugin, users can input any text they want to translate, choose their desired target language, and the plugin will output the translated text in the terminal. This plugin makes it more convenient for users to translate text without having to switch to a separate application or window.                                                                                                  |
| `commit`    | The `commit` plugin allows users to generate a Git commit message automatically by simply entering `gptcli commit` in the terminal. The plugin will use the content from the `Git diff` to create a suitable commit message, making it easier for users to commit changes without having to manually craft a commit message themselves. This plugin helps streamline the Git commit process and saves users time and effort.    Inspired By [aicommit](https://github.com/Nutlope/aicommits) |
| `gitmoji`   | The gitmoji plugin allows users to generate Git commit messages in the [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev/) format by using the command "gptcli gitmoji" followed by a brief description of the commit, such as "fix a bug". This plugin utilizes emojis to provide visual representations of the type of commit being made(e.g: `üêõ fix a bug`), making it easier for users to categorize and understand the purpose of each commit.  üéâüöÄüëç                                                         |
| `cz`        | the `cz` plugin                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `weather`   | The `weather` plugin allows users to check the weather in any city with Natural language,  it will generate a curl command to curl [wttr.in                                    ](https://github.com/chubin/wttr.in), and show the weather information in the terminal                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
